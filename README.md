### Instructions

In order to get this workflow to work:
1. Install the missing ComfyUI custom nodes via ComfyUI Manager.
2. Download the model checkpoint to models/checkpoints:
  * https://civitai.com/models/132632?modelVersionId=429454
3. Download the vae to models/vae:
  * https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse-original/blob/main/vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.ckpt
4. Download the lora to models/loras:
  * https://huggingface.co/OedoSoldier/detail-tweaker-lora/blob/main/add_detail.safetensors
5. Download the upscale model to models/upscale_models:
  * https://huggingface.co/databuzzword/esrgan/blob/main/RRDB_ESRGAN_x4.pth

You should then be able to run it.

You may tweak:
- The model, vae, prompts, loras, or upscale model (cyan boxes)
- The sampler parameters or seed (red boxes).
- The output configuration (purple boxes), for example if you want to save x4-upscaled pictures as well.

Increasing resolution above 512x768 may cause artifacts such as duplicated heads.
